# Maze-game

## Description

A programme that generates a maze and lets a player try to navigate it to reach a goal. \
The goal is denoted by a red X. \
The maze will change slightly every time the player moves. \
The ghost denotes the area around which the maze will change when the player moves next. \
The aim is to reach the goal in as few moves as possible (with as low of a score as possible).
